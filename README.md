## 📌 What's Inside?  

👨‍💻 **Fundamentals** – Understanding basic syntax & structure.  
📝 **Control Flow** – Loops, conditionals, and decision-making.  
🛠️ **Functions & Recursion** – Modular programming techniques.  
🗃️ **Arrays & Pointers** – Memory management in C.  
📂 **File Handling** – Reading/writing files in C.  

Each program is well-commented and follows best coding practices.

## 🎯 Why Learn C?  

C is the foundation of modern programming languages and is widely used for:  

🖥 **System Programming** – Operating systems, kernels, and device drivers.  
🎮 **Game Development** – Many gaming engines use C/C++.  
🚀 **Embedded Systems** – Microcontrollers and IoT applications.  
⚡ **High-Performance Computing** – Memory-efficient and fast execution.

## 🔥 Getting Started  

### 📥 Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satyajit1106/-C-Basics.git
cd -C-Basics
```

### 🚀 Compile & Run a C Program  

1️⃣ Install a C compiler (**GCC** recommended).  
2️⃣ Open a terminal or command prompt.  
3️⃣ Navigate to the repository folder.  
4️⃣ Compile and execute:  

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

🎯 **Example:** Running a simple "Hello, World!" program:  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World! 🚀\n");
    return 0;
}
```

🖥 Output:  
```
Hello, World! 🚀
```
